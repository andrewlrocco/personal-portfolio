Hi, I’m Andrew Rocco — an embedded systems and hardware engineer with experience across research, product development, and RF design. I specialize in developing robust hardware-software solutions and am passionate about building systems that are reliable, scalable, and production-ready.

I'm currently working as an Design Engineer at Boeing, where I contribute to custom system designs for 787 customers. My previous internships include:

- **R&D Engineer at Siemens**, where I worked on embedded solutions for industrial systems
- **Product Engineer at Texas Instruments**, supporting high-volume silicon validation and test automation
- **RF Engineer at Atlanta Micro**, developing and testing high-frequency analog front ends

My technical background includes:

- **Embedded firmware development** (bare-metal and RTOS-based)
- **PCB design** and hardware bring-up
- **Analog and digital circuit design**
- **Wireless protocols** including BLE, LoRa, and UART/SPI/CAN
- **Validation and test** using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and automated test setups

I bring a systems-level approach to engineering — from schematic to firmware to functional test — and I’m equally comfortable in the lab or in a debugging session. While my focus is embedded systems and hardware engineering, I’m open to roles across the broader field of **electrical and computer engineering**, including signal processing, robotics, or systems integration.

Academically, I hold both a **B.S. in Electrical Engineering** (with a **Minor in Robotics**) and an **M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering**, both from **Georgia Tech**. My education and experience span low-power design, embedded control systems, and high-frequency hardware.

To learn more:

- Visit the [**Projects**](/projects/) page to see examples of my work
- View my [**Resume**](/cv/) for more detail on my experience and skills
- Use the [**Contact**](/contact/) page to get in touch

I’m currently open to new opportunities and always happy to connect with teams building great hardware.
