Hi, I’m Andrew Rocco — an embedded systems and hardware engineer with a strong foundation in both theoretical design and hands-on implementation.

I'm currently working at [Your Current Company] as an embedded systems engineer, where I focus on developing reliable low-level firmware and hardware for real-world applications. Previously, I completed three internships that helped shape my practical engineering skills and industry perspective:
- At [Internship Company 1], I worked on [brief focus area, e.g., "PCB layout and low-power circuit design"].
- At [Internship Company 2], I gained experience in [e.g., "wireless sensor networks and test automation"].
- At [Internship Company 3], I contributed to [e.g., "firmware development for embedded control systems"].

My core expertise lies in embedded systems and hardware engineering — specifically:
- **PCB design**
- **Firmware development** (bare-metal and RTOS-based)
- **Analog and digital circuit design**
- **Wireless protocols** such as BLE, LoRa, and UART
- **Validation and test equipment** (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, functional test setups)

I'm passionate about building systems from the ground up — from initial schematic capture to firmware bring-up and in-system validation. That said, I’m also open to roles across the broader field of electrical and computer engineering, including signal processing, robotics, and systems integration.

I hold a **B.S. in Electrical Engineering** with a **minor in Robotics**, and an **M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering**, both from **Georgia Tech**. My academic and project experience span low-power embedded platforms, control systems, and hardware-software co-design.

Feel free to explore the rest of my site:
- Visit the [**Projects**](/projects/) page for a detailed look at some of the work I’ve done.
- View my [**Resume**](/cv/) to learn more about my background and technical experience.
- Head to [**Contact**](/contact/) if you'd like to reach out regarding opportunities or collaborations.

Thanks for visiting — I’m always excited to connect with others who are passionate about building, debugging, and delivering great hardware systems.
